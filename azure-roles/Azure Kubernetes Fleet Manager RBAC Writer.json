  "description": "Grants read/write access to most Kubernetes resources within a namespace in the fleet-managed hub cluster. This role does not allow viewing or modifying roles or role bindings. However, this role allows accessing Secrets as any ServiceAccount in the namespace, so it can be used to gain the API access levels of any ServiceAccount in the namespace.  Applying this role at cluster scope will give access across all namespaces.",
